# Neural Network
This is a barebones attempt at developing a neural network implementation from scratch, using only Eigen for linear algebra. It is based on the deep learning video series by <a href="https://youtu.be/aircAruvnKk?si=prFFrvRNSP6NW17c">3B1B</a>. It performs the classic task of handwritten digit recognition from the MNIST dataset. The application allows for the creation of fully fused networks with variable hidden layers and layer widths. It performs training and testing and allows models to be saved.
